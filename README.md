# ChatUtils - Copy messages with a click + anti spam + Word Unscramle Integration

This extremely simple mod is meant to be used as a utility for server staff or even normal players to be able to copy chat messages.

With a new feature, chat spamming is now controlled thanks to ChatMacros' anti spam, based on TabbyChat 2, which is unfortunately only Forge for now.

Only the latest MC versions are supported. This means that whenever an update is done, it will only be made for the current MC version, if the mod is correctly updated. 

## How to add it to your client

- Put Fabric API, MaLiLib, Fabric Mod Menu and ChatMacros' files in the mods folder (by default, %appdata%\\.minecraft\\mods), or if you're in Linux, ~/.minecraft/mods.
- Start Minecraft. You should see a button called "Mods" with the amount. Click on it and see if everything loaded fine.

## How to use it
ChatUtils is a very simple mod, so it's also very simple to use. By default, hovering received messages in chat should show a tooltip with a preview of what is going to be copied. To copy it to clipboard, simply click the message.

## Settings
To change ChatMacros' settings, press ESC if you're in game and click in the mods button (or simply click on the mods button if you're in the main menu), select ChatMacros in the mod list, and click in a small square settings icon, in the top right.
